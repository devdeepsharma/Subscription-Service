# Subscription Service

## Project Description

The Subscription Service is a decentralized smart contract built on Ethereum that enables businesses to implement recurring payment functionality with automatic billing cycles. This contract allows service providers to create subscription plans and automatically collect payments from subscribers at regular intervals, eliminating the need for manual payment processing and providing a seamless user experience.

The system operates on a prepaid model where users deposit funds into their account balance, and the contract automatically deducts subscription fees when payments are due. This approach ensures reliable payment processing while giving users full control over their subscription funds.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize subscription-based business models by leveraging blockchain technology to create a trustless, transparent, and automated payment system. We aim to eliminate traditional payment processing friction, reduce transaction costs, and provide both businesses and consumers with a more efficient and secure way to handle recurring payments.

By building on blockchain technology, we ensure that all transactions are transparent, immutable, and free from central authority control, giving users complete ownership of their subscription data and payment history.
